# AMP Twig Theme
> AMP oriented theme for Twig template engine

## Requirements
PHP >= 7.0

## Contributing
This library follows Twig coding standards, so pull requests need to execute the Allocine's [TwigCs][1]. In order
to simplify we provide a Composer script that wraps all the commands related with this process.
```bash
$ composer run-script cs
```

There is also a policy for contributing to this bundle. Pull requests must be explained step by step to make the
review process easy in order to accept and merge them.
